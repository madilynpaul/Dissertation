	abstract = {Absorbed sunlight in a solar cell produces electrons and holes. However, at the open-circuit condition, the carriers have no place to go. They build up in density, and ideally, they emit external luminescence that exactly balances the incoming sunlight. Any additional nonradiative recombination impairs the carrier density buildup, limiting the open-circuit voltage. At open circuit, efﬁcient external luminescence is an indicator of low internal optical losses. Thus, efﬁcient external luminescence is, counterintuitively, a necessity for approaching the Shockley–Queisser ({SQ}) efﬁciency limit. A great solar cell also needs to be a great light-emitting diode. Owing to the narrow escape cone for light, efﬁcient external emission requires repeated attempts and demands an internal luminescence efﬁciency {\textgreater}{\textgreater}90\%.},

            Increasing global demand for energy, along with dwindling fossil fuel resources and a better understanding of the hidden costs associated with these energy sources, have spurred substantial political, academic, and industrial interest in alternative energy resources. Photovoltaics based on organic semiconductors have emerged as promising low-cost alternatives for electricity generation that relies on sunlight. In this tutorial review we discuss the relevance of these organic photovoltaics beginning with some of the economic drivers for these technologies. We then examine the basic properties of these devices, including operation and materials requirements, in addition to presenting the development of the field from a historical perspective. Potential future directions are also briefly discussed. This tutorial review is intended to be an essential overview of the progress of the field, in addition to aiding in the discussion of the future of {OPV} technologies.},

Chlorobenzene and acetone were employed to wash away unnecessary residual high-resistance materials after full modules were fabricated. Monolithic interconnecting electrode lines between the anode and the cathode were formed using a dispenser after wash process. The wash process allowed for minimization of interconnection resistance and enhancement of power conversion efﬁciency. Module efﬁciency changes were also studied by varying the coating conditions of {PEIE}. The power conversion efﬁciency increased as a result of the wash-off process compared with modules fabricated via conventional processes. The power conversion efﬁciency enhancement was attributed to increases in open circuit voltage and ﬁll factor. Applying this wash-off process to larger-area {OPV} modules is expected to be effective for further enhancing power conversion efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {The objective of this article is to identify how organic photovoltaic cells have been addressed in scientific studies published until 2022. To this end, a literature review was conducted, which involved the search for articles through the Advanced Search tool of the Periodicals portal of the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel, as well as the preparation of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to assist in the classifying the articles, followed by a structured analysis of the structure, operating principle, materials, performance parameters, stability/life span/degradation, challenges, opportunities, and applications of organic photovoltaic cells. The results of this research point out that organic photovoltaic devices are formed by electrodes (anode, such as indium-tin oxide, silver nanowires, carbon nanotubes and graphene and cathode, such as calcium, barium, or aluminum), hole transport layers ({PEDOT}:{PSS}), and electrons ({ZnO} or the {TiO}2), as well as by the active layer (donor, such as P3HT or {PTB}7, and acceptor, such as C60 and C70 fullerenes and their {PCBM} derivatives, as well as non-fulerene acceptors). We further identify that the working principle of organic photovoltaic cells consists in the generation of photocurrent from the absorption of a photon that results in an exciton, this in turn diffuses to the donor–acceptor interface, and disassociates into free carriers, which carry collected charges to the electrodes. We find that organic photovoltaic cells are simple to manufacture, less expensive, more flexible, lightweight, and that the development of these devices has advanced in recent years. However, for practical relevance, some challenges need to be overcome, including power conversion efficiency, stability, degradation, lifetime, as well as fabrication of large areas through roll-to-roll methods.},

In this review article we discuss advances in three areas of computational modelling that provide insight into active layer morphology and the charge transport properties that result. We explain the computational bottlenecks prohibiting atomisticallydetailed simulations of device-scale active layers and the coarse-graining and hardware acceleration strategies for overcoming them. We review coarse-grained simulations of {OPV} active layers and show that high throughput simulations of experimentally-relevant length scales are now accessible. We describe a new Python package diﬀractometer that permits grazing-incidence X-ray scattering patterns of simulated active layers to be compared against experiments. We explain the accurate calculation of charge-carrier mobilities from coarse-grained active layer morphologies by using atomistic backmapping, quantum chemical calculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We employ these simulations to show that ordering of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) explains a factor of 1000 improvement in charge mobility. In concert, we present a suite of computational tools enabling large-scale electronic properties of organic photovoltaics to be studied and screened for by molecular simulations.},

Organic salts, a class of small molecule organic compounds comprised of an ionic chromophore and a counterion, have been used in opaque and transparent photovoltaics, primarily as donor materials in bilayer architectures. They possess excellent molecular extinction coefficients with near-infrared selective absorption, adjustable bandgaps, and tunable energy levels. To approach organic salt photovoltaics from a new perspective, we fabricated devices with an unexplored group of anionic salts comprised of a near-infrared absorbing chromophore paired with a varying number of cationic counterions. We observed different donor and acceptor decay trends in external quantum efficiencies that allowed us to separate and independently quantify exciton diffusion and charge transfer for each salt. Increased charge character on the chromophore greatly improves hole transport, as anions with a net −3 charge have charge collection lengths greater than four times those of corresponding singly charged chromophores. This presents an interesting platform for independent quantification of exciton diffusion and charge transport of an active material in a single photovoltaic device and demonstration of the important role of charge on the chromophore. The dependence of charge transport capabilities on charge character of the chromophore will be a useful tool in the design of future organic salts to engineer materials for higher efficiency transparent photovoltaics.},

	abstract = {Adequate initial conﬁgurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system’s overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some speciﬁed tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input ﬁles are simple and currently compatible with {PDB}, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate ﬁles.

For liquid densities, heats of vaporization, and free energies of hydration, the average errors are 0.01 g/cm3, 0.2 kcal/mol, and ca. 0.5 kcal/mol, respectively; significant gains were made for relative heats of vaporization of isomeric series. Results for self-diffusion coefficients also reproduce experimental data well for linear alkane liquids up to hexadecane.

	abstract = {Density functional theory ({DFT}) is a well-established tool for calculating the properties of materials. The volume of {DFT}-related publications doubles every 5–6 years, which has resulted in the appearance of continuously growing open material databases, containing information on millions of compounds. Furthermore, the results of {DFT} computations are frequently coupled with experimental ones to strengthen the computational findings. In this thesis, several applications of {DFT} related to physics and chemistry are discussed. The conductivity between {MoS}2 and transition metal nanoparticles is evaluated by calculating the electronic structure of two different models for the nanoparticles. Chemical bonding of Ni to the {MoS}2 host is proven by the system’s band alignment. To meet the demand for cleaner fuel, the applicability of the (103) edge surface of molybdenum disulfide in relation to the early stages of the hydrodesulfurization ({HDS}) reaction is considered. The occurrence of the (103) edge surface of molybdenum disulfide in the {XRD} patterns is explained. A method for calculating oxidation states based on partial charges using open materials databases is suggested. We estimate the applicability of the method in the case of mixed valence compounds and surfaces, showing that {DFT} calculations can be used for the estimation of oxidation states.},

	abstract = {Molecular simulations have the potential to advance the understanding of how the structure of organic materials can be engineered through the choice of chemical components but are limited by computational costs. The computational costs can be signiﬁcantly lowered through the use of modeling approximations that capture the relevant features of a system, while lowering algorithmic complexity or by decreasing the degrees of freedom that must be integrated. Such methods include coarse-graining techniques, approximating long-range electrostatics with short-range potentials, and the use of rigid bodies to replace ﬂexible bonded constraints between atoms. To understand whether and to what degree these techniques can be leveraged to enhance the understanding of planar organic molecules, we investigate the morphologies predicted by molecular dynamic simulations using simpliﬁed molecular models of perylene and perylothiophene. Approximately, 10 000 wall-clock hours of graphics processing unit-accelerated simulations are performed using both rigid and ﬂexible models to test their eﬃciency and predictive capability with the two chemistries. We characterize the 1191 resulting morphologies using simulated X-ray diﬀraction and cluster analysis to distinguish structural transitions, summarized by four phase diagrams. We ﬁnd that the morphologies generated by the rigid model of perylene and perylothiophene match with those generated by the ﬂexible model. We ﬁnd that ordered, hexagonally packed columnar phases are thermodynamically favored over a wide range of densities and temperatures for both molecules, in qualitative agreement with experiments. Furthermore, we ﬁnd the rigid model to be more computationally eﬃcient for both molecules, providing more samples per second and shorter times to equilibrium. Owing to the structural accuracy and improved computational eﬃciency of modeling polyaromatic groups as rigid bodies, we recommend this modeling choice for enhancing the sampling in polyaromatic molecular simulations.},

The features of the donor−acceptor morphology (e.g., domain shapes, crystalline/amorphous domains, and donor−acceptor interface) can in principle be tuned by choosing the chemistry and architecture of the conjugated polymer, fullerene functional group, solvents, and processing conditions (e.g., annealing temperature). Here, we present a highthroughput coarse-grained simulation study that links molecularlevel design parameters to features in the assembled morphology in neat polymers and donor−acceptor blends. These models reproduce neat polymer morphologies observed in experiments, such as lamellae, hexagonally packed cylinders, and acceptor intercalation among donor side chains. Furthermore, for blends of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives, this study shows how conjugated polymer architecture and acceptor miscibility can be tailored to obtain new blend morphologies, which have features that are known to be optimal for higher eﬃciency solar cells.},

In this work, we utilize quantum chemical calculations ({QCC}) and kinetic Monte Carlo ({KMC}) simulations to predict the zero-ﬁeld hole mobilities of ∼100 morphologies of the benchmark polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene), with varying simulation volume, structural order, and chain-length polydispersity. Morphologies with monodisperse chains were generated previously using an optimized molecular dynamics force-ﬁeld and represent a spectrum of nanostructured order. We discover that a combined consideration of backbone clustering and system-wide disorder arising from side-chain conformations are correlated with hole mobility. Furthermore, we show that strongly interconnected thiophene backbones are required for efﬁcient charge transport. This deﬁnitively shows the role “tie-chains” play in enabling mobile charges in P3HT. By marrying {QCC} and {KMC} over multiple length- and time-scales, we demonstrate that it is now possible to routinely probe the relationship between molecular nanostructure and device performance.},

We perform molecular dynamics simulations to predict the self-assembly of P3HT at ∼350 combinations of temperature and solvent quality. Our structural calculations predict that the highest degrees of order are obtained with good solvents just below the melting temperature.

	abstract = {Accurate descriptions of intermolecular interactions are of great importance in simulations of molecular liquids. We present an electronic structure method that combines the accuracy of the Harris functional approach with the computational efficiency of approximately linearscaling density functional theory ({DFT}). The non-variational nature of the Harris functional has been addressed by constructing a Lagrangian energy functional, which restores the variational condition by imposing stationarity with respect to the reference density. The associated linear response equations may be treated with linear-scaling efficiency in an atomic orbital based scheme. Key ingredients to describe the structural and dynamical properties of molecular systems are the forces acting on the atoms and the stress tensor. These first-order derivatives of the Harris Lagrangian have been derived and implemented in consistence with the energy correction. The proposed method allows for simulations with accuracies close to the Kohn–Sham {DFT} reference. Embedded in the {CP}2K program package, the method is designed to enable ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of molecular solutions for system sizes of several thousand atoms. Available subsystem {DFT} methods may be used to provide the reference density required for the energy correction at near linear-scaling efficiency. As an example of production applications, we applied the method to molecular dynamics simulations of the binary mixtures cyclohexane-methanol and toluene-methanol, performed within the isobaric-isothermal ensemble, to investigate the hydrogen bonding network in these non-ideal mixtures.},

	abstract = {Within the framework of constrained density functional theory ({CDFT}), the diabatic or charge localized states of electron transfer ({ET}) have been constructed. Based on the diabatic states, inner reorganization energy λin has been directly calculated. For solvent reorganization energy λs, a novel and reasonable nonequilibrium solvation model is established by introducing a constrained equilibrium manipulation, and a new expression of λs has been formulated. It is found that λs is actually the cost of maintaining the residual polarization, which equilibrates with the extra electric ﬁeld. On the basis of diabatic states constructed by {CDFT}, a numerical algorithm using the new formulations with the dielectric polarizable continuum model (D-{PCM}) has been implemented. As typical test cases, self-exchange {ET} reactions between tetracyanoethylene ({TCNE}) and tetrathiafulvalene ({TTF}) and their corresponding ionic radicals in acetonitrile are investigated. The calculated reorganization energies λ are 7293 cm−1 for {TCNE}/{TCNE}− and 5939 cm−1 for {TTF}/{TTF}+ reactions, agreeing well with available experimental results of 7250 cm−1 and 5810 cm−1, respectively.},

For {OPV} materials, it is a broad agreement that ﬂuorination can reduce the energy level and change the morphology of active layers. To explore the effect of ﬂuorination on small molecule acceptors, we selected two non-fullerene acceptors ({NFA}) based bulk heterojunction ({BHJ}) ﬁlms, involving {PM}6:Y6 and {PM}6:Y5 as model systems. The electron mobilities of the {PM}6:Y5 and {PM}6:Y6 {BHJ} ﬁlms are 5.76 × 10−7 cm2V−1s−1 and 5.02 × 10−5 cm2V−1s−1 from the space-charge-limited current ({SCLC}) measurements. Through molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulation, it is observed that halogen bonds can be formed between Y6 dimers, which can provide external channels for electron carrier transfer. Meanwhile, the “A-to-A” type J-aggregates are more likely to be generated between Y6 molecules, and the π–π stacking can be also enhanced, thus increasing the charge transfer rate and electron mobility between Y6 molecules.},

In this study, we eval­ uated the role played by the small molecule Y6 as the third component in additive-free {PM}6 (polymer): Y6:{IT}-4F (small molecule) ternary {OPVs}. We used {UV}–Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and tappingmode atomic force microscopy to study the effects of various blend ratios on the optoelectronic properties of these {OPVs}. At the optimized {PM}6:Y6:{IT}-4F blend ratio (1:0.35:0.75), we observed the presence of Y6:{IT}-4F intermediates that efficiently suppressed the over-segregation of Y6 and increased the degree of carrier trans­ port. The optimized ternary {OPV} delivered an average power conversion efficiency ({PCE}) of 13.6 � 0.29\% and the best {PCE} of 14.14\%, which was 23\% enhancement compared with the binary {OPV}. The findings suggest that dual effects, caused by the use of solvent and optimization of the blending ratio of primary and secondary ac­ ceptors, significantly influence the performance of {OPVs}.},

Given the current urgent concerns regarding climate change, research into renewable energy solutions is crucially important. In this perspective article, we highlight several key aspects of organic photovoltaics, ranging from fundamental understanding to implementation, that need to be addressed to ensure the success of this promising technology. We cover the intriguing ability of some acceptors to undergo efficient charge photogeneration in the absence of an energetic driving force and the effects of the resulting state hybridization. We explore one of the primary loss mechanisms of organic photovoltaics—non-radiative voltage losses—and the influence of the energy gap law. Triplet states are becoming increasingly relevant owing to their presence in even the most efficient non-fullerene blends, and we assess their role as both a loss mechanism and a potential strategy to enhance efficiency. Finally, two ways in which the implementation of organic photovoltaics can be simplified are addressed. The standard bulk heterojunction architecture could be superseded by either single material photovoltaics or sequentially deposited heterojunctions, and the attributes of both are considered. While several important challenges still lie ahead for organic photovoltaics, their future is, indeed, bright.},

The quantum chemical calculation of transfer integrals for all the molecular pairs in organic materials is usually an unaffordable task; fortunately, it can be accelerated by the data-driven machine learning method now. In this work, we develop machine learning models based on artificial neutral networks to predict transfer integrals accurately and efficiently for four typical organic semiconductor molecules: quadruple thiophene ({QT}), pentacene, rubrene, and dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ({DNTT}). We test various forms of features and labels and evaluate the accuracy of different models. With the implementation of a data augmentation scheme, we have achieved a very high accuracy with the determination coefficient of 0.97 and mean absolute error of 4.5 {meV} for {QT}, and similar accuracy for the other three molecules. We apply these models to studying charge transport in organic crystals with dynamic disorders at 300 K and obtain the charge mobility and anisotropy in perfect agreement with the brutal force quantum chemical calculation. If more molecular packings representing the amorphous phase of organic solids are supplemented to the dataset, the current models can be refined to study charge transport in organic thin films with polymorphs and static disorders.},

These high performances, together with the suitability of the technology to inexpensive large-scale manufacture, over lightweight and ﬂexible plastic substrates using roll-to-roll (R2R) processing, place the technology amongst the most promising for future harvesting of solar energy. Although {OPVs} using non-fullerene acceptors have recently outperformed their fullerene-based counterparts, the research in the development of new fullerenes and in the improvement of the bulk-heterojunction ({BHJ}) morphology and device efﬁciency of polymer:fullerene solar cells remains very active. In this review article, the most relevant research works performed over the last 3 years, that is, since the year 2016 onwards, in the ﬁeld of fullerene-based polymer solar cells based on the copolymers {PTB}7, {PTB}7-Th (also known as {PBDTTT}-{EFT}) and {PffBT}4T-2OD, are presented and discussed. This review is primarily focused on studies that involve the improvement of the {BHJ} morphology, efﬁciency and stability of small active area devices (typically {\textless} 15 mm2), through the use of different processing strategies such as the use of different fullerene acceptors, different processing solvents and additives and different thermal treatments.},

	abstract = {Crystalline barbituric acid dihydrate ({BTADH}) was previously thought to undergo a subtle temperaturedependent phase transition from a high-temperature orthorhombic Pnma space group to a nonmerohedrally twinned monoclinic P21/n phase below a transition temperature of ∼217 K. Questions remain on the true nature of the unusual transformation and the structure of the high-temperature crystal phase due to diﬃculties in resolving the Pnma structure from X-ray diﬀraction data and because of the subtlety of the structural transition. In this study, terahertz ({THz}) spectroscopy and solid-state density functional theory ({DFT}) were utilized to explore this suspected phase transition and uncover the principle physical mechanisms contributing to this anomalous transition. Our ﬁndings suggest that at temperatures above the previously reported phase transition temperature of 217 K, the crystal does not exist in the Pnma space group conﬁguration. However, two equivalent favorable energetic states with P21/n symmetry related by the twinning plane lie on either side of the proposed Pnma structure. It is these same local potential energy minima that guide the crystal system to a nonmerohedrally twinned conﬁguration identiﬁed in the lowtemperature crystal structures. At temperatures above 217 K, the system possesses the thermal energy necessary to readily transition between these degenerate states separated by the low-lying Pnma structural barrier. The evidence acquired by {THz} spectroscopy and {DFT} indicate the absence of a true temperature-dependent phase change, and rather a system that exists in a tenuous thermally disordered state above the previously alleged transition temperature.},

This study elucidated the direct effect of subtle differences in the π-orbital overlap on charge carrier mobility, by precisely controlling only molecular arrangements without any chemical modifications. We synthesized disulfonic acid composed of a [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene ({BTBT}) moiety, and prepared organic salts with four butylamine isomers. Regardless of the type of butylamine combined, electronic states of the constituent {BTBT} derivative were identical, and all {BTBT} arrangements were edge-to-face herringbone-type. However, depending on the difference of steric hindrance, center-to-center distances and dihedral angles between neighboring {BTBT} moieties slightly varied. Despite a similar arrangement, the photoconductivity of four organic salts differed by a factor of approximately two. Additionally, theoretical charge carrier mobilities from their crystal structures exhibited a strong correlation with their photoconductivity.},

Organic photovoltaics ({OPVs}) are a competitive clean energy emerging technology and will undoubtedly have a market niche in a world that needs to take advantage of every possible type of renewable energy. Recent studies have brought relevant improvements on internal efficiency, focusing on two properties at the interface: energetic disorder and bending. However, how positional disorder affects internal efficiency is still an open question. Here, we show that positional disorder is desired at the interface, but only up to a threshold value of 0.2 nm for poly p-phenylene vinylene. Using a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator, we realized that not enough excitons were reaching the interface, and introduced the Beer-Lambert law of attenuance to correct it. Furthermore, we realized that the same disorder that facilitates charge separation at the interface diminishes exciton and charge mobility in bulk, so we propose here a new morphology for the active layer of {OPVs}. Our suggestion implicates in better overall performance, improving not just the internal but the overall cell efficiency.},

This includes the mapping of the problem onto a lattice and the derivation of rate constant expressions for various elementary processes. Example {KMC} models will be presented within the application areas surface diffusion, crystal growth and heterogeneous catalysis, covering both transient and steady-state kinetics as well as the preparation of various initial states of the system. We highlight the sensitivity of {KMC} models to the elementary processes included, as well as to possible errors in the rate constants. For catalysis models in particular, a recurrent challenge is the occurrence of processes at very different timescales, e.g., fast diffusion processes and slow chemical reactions. We demonstrate how to overcome this timescale disparity problem using recently developed acceleration algorithms. Finally, we will discuss how to account for lateral interactions between the species adsorbed to the lattice, which can play an important role in all application areas covered here.},

Here, we leverage small-angle neutron scattering to measure the chain shapes of several classes of commonly used, high mobility donor−acceptor conjugated polymers in dilute solution. We ﬁnd that these model conjugated polymers are semiﬂexible with persistence lengths ranging from several to hundreds of nanometers, dependent on the molecular structure of the polymer, indicating the importance of repeat unit geometry, particularly side-chain size and branching, on the overall chain conformations. The measured persistence lengths show good agreement with those calculated according to dihedral distributions predicted from density functional theory. Larger persistence lengths are shown to correlate with increased charge-carrier mobility, signifying the importance of rational molecular design to obtain high persistence length organic semiconductors and thus advantageous optoelectronic properties.},

We present a framework designed to aid in the integration of various specialized data formats, tools and workﬂows. The signac framework provides all basic components required to create a well-deﬁned and thus collectively accessible and searchable data space, simplifying data access and modiﬁcation through a homogeneous data interface that is largely agnostic to the data source, i.e., computation or experiment. The framework’s data model is designed to not require absolute commitment to the presented implementation, simplifying adaption into existing data sets and workﬂows.

	abstract = {Molecular mechanics ({MM}) potentials have long been a workhorse of computational chemistry. Leveraging accuracy and speed, these functional forms ﬁnd use in a wide variety of applications in biomolecular modeling and drug discovery, from rapid virtual screening to detailed free energy calculations. Traditionally, {MM} potentials have relied on human-curated, inﬂexible, and poorly extensible discrete chemical perception rules (atom types) for applying parameters to small molecules or biopolymers, making it diﬃcult to optimize both types and parameters to ﬁt quantum chemical or physical property data. Here, we propose an alternative approach that uses graph neural networks to perceive chemical environments, producing continuous atom embeddings from which valence and nonbonded parameters can be predicted using invariance-preserving layers. Since all stages are built from smooth neural functions, the entire process—spanning chemical perception to parameter assignment—is modular and end-to-end diﬀerentiable with respect to model parameters, allowing new force ﬁelds to be easily constructed, extended, and applied to arbitrary molecules. We show that this approach is not only suﬃciently expressive to reproduce legacy atom types, but that it can learn to accurately reproduce and extend existing molecular mechanics force ﬁelds. Trained with arbitrary loss functions, it can construct entirely new force ﬁelds self-consistently applicable to both biopolymers and small molecules directly from quantum chemical calculations, with superior ﬁdelity than traditional atom or parameter typing schemes. When adapted to simultaneously ﬁt partial charge models, espaloma delivers high-quality partial atomic charges orders of magnitude faster than current bestpractices with little inaccuracy. When trained on the same quantum chemical small molecule dataset used to parameterize the Open Force Field ("Parsley") openﬀ-1.2.0 small molecule force ﬁeld augmented with a peptide dataset, the resulting espaloma model shows superior accuracy vis-à-vis experiments in computing relative alchemical free energy calculations for a popular benchmark set. This approach is implemented in the free and open source package espaloma, available at https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma.},

In this work, we investigate an etching process of fused glassy silica by {HF} gas with kinetic Monte Carlo ({KMC}) simulations. Detailed pathways of surface reactions between gas molecules and the silica surface with activation energy sets are explicitly implemented in the {KMC} algorithm for both dry and humid conditions. The {KMC} model successfully describes the etching of the silica surface with the evolution of surface morphology up to the micron regime. The simulation results show that the calculated etch rate and surface roughness are in good agreement with the experimental results, and the effect of humidity on the etch rate is also confirmed. Development of roughness is theoretically analyzed in terms of surface roughening phenomena, and it is predicted that the values of growth and roughening exponents are 0.19 and 0.33, respectively, suggesting that our model belongs to the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of surface chemistry, specifically surface hydroxyls and fluorine groups, is monitored. The surface density of fluorine moieties is 2.5 times higher than that of the hydroxyl groups, implying that the surface is well fluorinated during vapor etching.},

The {BT}4 show wider absorption proﬁle and lower bandgap as compared to {BT}3 due to the strong electron withdrawing ability of dicyanoquinodimethane ({DCNQ}) as compared to tetracyanobutadiene ({TCBD}). The solution processed bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using {BT}3 and {BT}4 as electron donor and {PC}71BM as electron acceptor. The organic solar cells optimized dichloromethane ({DCM}) processed {BT}3:{PC}71BM (1:1) and {BT}4:{PC}71BM (1:1) showed {PCE} of 2.56\% and 3.68\%, respectively. The higher {PCE} of {BT}4:{PC}71BM is related to the wider absorption of the blend and better ordered domain sizes in the blend as compared to {BT}3:{PC}71BM.

	abstract = {Owing to their capacity to self-assemble into organized nanostructures, amyloid polypeptides can serve as scaffolds for the design of biocompatible semiconductive materials. Herein, symmetric and asymmetric amyloid π-conjugated peptides were prepared through condensation of perylene diimide ({PDI}) with a natural amyloidogenic sequence derived from the islet amyloid polypeptide. These {PDI}-bioconjugates assembled into long and linear nanofilaments in aqueous solution, which were characterized by a cross-β-sheet quaternary organization. Current−voltage curves exhibited a clear signature of semiconductors, whereas the cellular assays revealed cytocompatibility and potential application in fluorescence microscopy. Although the incorporation of a single amyloid peptide appeared sufficient to drive the selfassembly into organized fibrils, the incorporation of two peptide sequences at the {PDI}’s imide positions significantly enhanced the conductivity of nanofibril-based films. Overall, this study exposes a novel strategy based on amyloidogenic peptide to guide the selfassembly of π-conjugated systems into robust, biocompatible, and optoelectronic nanofilaments.},

However, very few studies have been reported in this field. The semiconducting properties of conjugated polymers could be regulated through regioregularity adjustment. Here, we took the asymmetric thiophene/pyridine side group {DPP} as core and developed the regioregular monomer T-Py-{DPP} through three steps: alkyl chain introduction, tin monomer coupling and {NBS} double bromination. The T-Py-{DPP} monomer was polymerized into reg-{PPyTDPP}-2FBT with a head-to-head structure. The regioregularity of T-Py-{DPP} unit endowed reg-{PPyTDPP}-2FBT with backbone planarity, self-assembly orientation, network-like morphology and high crystallinity in films, thus the superior bipolar transport properties. The highest hole and electron mobilities of reg-{PPyTDPP}-2FBT were 0.93 and 0.57 cm2·V−1·s−1, respectively, with 40\% improvement relative to the regiorandom polymer.},

	abstract = {Several conjugated polymers have been designed for applications in thermoelectrics ({TEs}) to improve doping efficiency and charge transport. However, optimizing the compatibility of the polymer with molecular dopants through judicious design to achieve high {TE} performance remains a challenge. By designing a novel donor−acceptor (D-A)-based conjugated polymer, poly(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-co-(4,7-bis(4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1b:3,4-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole) ({PBDTC}2FBT), compatibility with molecular dopants was maximized, resulting in enhanced {TE} properties. {PBDTC}2FBT was designed to include two types of electron donor building blocks with one acceptor in a repeat unit; this structure formed local short-range ordered crystals. Two molecular doping processes employing {FeCl}3 and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane ({BCF})−water complexes generated polaronic charge carriers in {PBDTC}2FBT while minimizing crystal deterioration. The transport behavior of the charge carriers in {PBDTC}2FBT differed depending on the dopant. Studies using the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity and Kang−Snyder charge transport models indicated that the weak Coulomb binding energy with the dopant counterion in {BCF}-doped {PBDTC}2FBT facilitated charge transport compared with that in the {FeCl}3-doped sample at the low doping region. Finally, {BCF}-doped {PBDTC}2FBT exhibited an optimized power factor of 35.1 μW m−1 K−2, which is extremely close to the theoretical maximum (36.3 μW m−1 K−2) that can be achieved with {PBDTC}2FBT. This study provides useful guidelines for maximizing the {TE} performance of D-A conjugated polymers through judicious design.},

It is demonstrated that the physicochemical properties of the materials with different bridges are similar.

At the same time, devices demonstrate spectacular long-term operation stability after 1000 h under constant illumination with minor changes in efﬁciency, while {PSCs} with state-of-the-art hole-transport layer demonstrate unstable behavior.

However, growing interest toward donor-acceptor polymers has led to the recent emergence of cross-dehydrogenative coupling ({CDC}) polymerization to synthesize alternating copolymers without any prefunctionalization of monomers. Metal-catalyzed crosscoupling of two simple arenes via double C–H activation, or of an arene with an alkene via oxidative Heck-type reaction have been used so far for {CDC} polymerization.

For {NR}, however, the resistance to thermal-oxidation and ozone aging is fairly poor. Although aging properties of {NR} can be signiﬁcantly improved with the incorporation of chloroprene rubber ({CR}) according to some references, the miscibility between {NR} and {CR}, the morphologies of the binary blends, and so on are revealed ambiguously. In this work, molecular dynamics simulation ({MD}) and dissipative particle dynamics ({DPD}) simulation were carried out to predict the compatibility between natural rubber and chloroprene rubber in view of Flory–Huggins parameters. The morphologies of the blends were obtained with the use of the {DPD} method. The simulation results were furtherly examined by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ({FT}-{IR}) and dynamic mechanical analysis ({DMA}). It was found that the miscibility between {NR} and {CR} is poor. Nevertheless, the miscibility could be improved when the content of {CR} is 50\% or 90\%. In addition, spinodal decomposition with a critical temperature of 390 K would take place according to the phase diagram. Microphase structure such as spherical, lamellar, and bicontinuous phases can be found with different contents of {CR} in the blends with the results of morphologies analysis.},

	abstract = {The switching ratio of a thermal switch is a key design parameter, and electrically activated switches based on thermoelectric effects have been reported to produce large switching ratios over a wide range of temperatures. Previous switches based on the Seebeck effect have switching ratios that are limited by the thermoelectric figure-of-merit {zT}. Perhaps, more importantly, they are limited by their device construction of alternating p-type and n-type materials with soldered junctions. Alternatively, we show that semiconducting polymers with spatially graded doping can offer similar switching ratios due to a volumetric heat absorption effect. This occurs in heavily doped polymers, which exhibit a sharp decrease in the Seebeck coefficient as charge carriers become fully delocalized. Such heat absorption is analogous to the Thomson effect, where heat is locally absorbed due to temperature-dependent variation of the Seebeck coefficient. Here, a theoretical model is derived to solve the 1D heat equation with spatially graded doping, allowing for optimization of the doping profile for a given material system. Four different material systems are compared according to an analysis of reported measurements to determine the upper limit of the switching ratio. A hypothetical Thomson switch based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with ferric tosylate can produce switching ratios up to 12 under a thermal bias of 10 K, a threefold increase compared to a Peltier switch of the same material. Like a Peltier switch, the switching ratio of a Thomson switch diverges under a small thermal bias. Under a large thermal bias, the switching ratio converges toward that of an equivalent Peltier switch.},

	abstract = {Dissipative particle dynamics ({DPD}) with bond uncrossability shows a great potential in studying entangled polymers, however relatively little is known of applicability range of entangled {DPD} model to be use as a model for ideal chains and properly describe the full dynamics of entangled melts. Therefore, we perform a comprehensive study on structure, dynamics and linear viscoelasticity of a typical {DPD} entangled model system, semiflexible linear polymer melt. These polymers obey Flory’s ideality hypothesis in chain dimensions, but their local structure exhibits nonideal behavior due to weak correlated hole effect. Both monomer motion and viscoelasticity relaxation reproduce the full pictures as predicted by reptation theory. The stronger chain length dependent diffusion coefficient and relaxation time as well as dynamic moduli are in close agreement with predictions of modern tube model that accounts for additional relaxation mechanisms besides chain reptation. However, an anomalous sub-diffusive center of mass motion is observed both before and after the intermediate reptation regime and the cross-correlation between chains is not negligible even these polymers obey stress-optical law, indicating limitations of the reptation theory. Hence semiflexible linear entangled {DPD} model can correctly describe statics and dynamics of entangled polymer melts.},

However, the complex synthesis of D18 series has limited their accessibility to the research community. We redesigned the original synthetic scheme of D18, particularly the key monomer, 5,8-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-butyloctyl)thiophen-2-yl)dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2″,3″:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Br2T2-{DTBT}), and replaced a few key steps in the original scheme that were hard to reproduce and/or low yielding with simple to operate and high yielding reactions. Carother’s equation was successfully applied to control/tune the molar mass of D18-Cl, and three representative molar masses (high, medium, and low) of D18-Cl were subject to device testing. It is discovered that a medium molar mass (56 kg/mol) D18-Cl offered the highest performance (average 16.6\%) when paired with Y6 as the acceptor in a typical {BHJ} device configuration, consistent with the literature report. This optimized synthesis of D18 series offers great synthetic tunability, and the modular nature/optimized key reactions will facilitate the design and synthesis of conjugated polymers for optoelectronics.},

The device geometry is inverted and allow for fabrication on both transparent and non-transparent ﬂexible substrates. The process is illustrated in this work by formation of a bottom electrode comprising silver nanoparticles on a 130 micron thick polyethyleneternaphthalate ({PEN}) substrate. Subsequently an electron transporting layer of zinc oxide nanoparticles was applied from solution followed by an active layer of P3HT-{PCBM} and a hole transporting layer of {PEDOT}:{PSS}. These ﬁrst four layers were applied by slot-die coating. The ﬁnal electrode was applied by screen printing a grid structure that allowed for transmission of 80\% of the light. The materials were patterned into stripes allowing for formation of a single cell device and serially connected modules comprising 2, 3 and 8 stripes. All ﬁve layers in the device were processed from solution in air and no vacuum steps were employed. An additional advantage is that the use of indium-tin-oxide ({ITO}) is avoided in this process. The devices were tested under simulated sunlight (1000 W {mÀ}2, {AM}1.5G) and gave a typical performance 0.3\% in terms of power conversion efﬁciency ({PCE}) for the active layer. The low {PCE} was due to poor transmission of light through the back electrode.},

We ﬁnd that the orientation of side chains along the oligomer backbone plays a more signiﬁcant role than side chain density, side chain−side chain interactions, or side chain length in determining the thermodynamically stable morphologies and the phase transition temperatures. Oligomers with side chains oriented on both sides of the backbone (“anti”) form lamellae, while oligomers with side chains oriented on one side of the backbone (“syn”) assemble into hexagonally packed cylinders that can undergo a second, lower temperature transition to lamellae or ribbons depending on side chain−side chain interaction strength. The strength of side chain−side chain interactions aﬀects the order−disorder temperature, with oligomers having moderately attractive side chains exhibiting higher transition temperatures than those with weakly attractive side chains. Side chain length modulates the spacing between morphological features, such as cylinders and lamellae, and aﬀects the order−disorder temperature diﬀerently depending on oligomer architecture.},

The Nblob values were used to determine lp.

              Polymorphism is a widespread phenomenon occurring in many solid materials having important effects in many scientific disciplines. Since molecular packing can determine the functional properties of materials but is often difficult to control, polymorphism has usually been considered a drawback for technological applications. Thanks to advances in its control over the past few years, polymorphism is now often considered more as an opportunity because it allows a much wider range of functionality in, for example, a solid molecular material, where a corresponding packing type can be selected or even promoted. This
              tutorial review
              introduces the reader to the most representative progress in applications of polymorphism as an additional functionality of materials especially in its current promise for technological applications. In addition, it examines the most powerful strategies to control and fully exploit the intrinsic properties of polymorphism and transitions between its various metastable states, through fine-tuning of molecular packing in a reproducible manner. The aim is to create awareness about polymorphism as a novel enabling technology rather than as a problem.},

              We present new facts about polymorphism based on (i) crystallographic data from the Cambridge Structural Database ({CSD}, a database built over 50 years of community effort), (ii) 229 solid form screens conducted at Hoffmann-La Roche and Eli Lilly and Company over the course of 8+ and 15+ years respectively and (iii) a dataset of 446 polymorphic crystals with energies and properties computed with modern {DFT}-d methods. We found that molecular flexibility or size has no correlation with the ability of a compound to be polymorphic. Chiral molecules, however, were found to be less prone to polymorphism than their achiral counterparts and compounds able to hydrogen bond exhibit only a slightly higher propensity to polymorphism than those which do not. Whilst the energy difference between polymorphs is usually less than 1 kcal mol
              −1
              , conformational polymorphs are capable of differing by larger values (up to 2.5 kcal mol
              −1
              in our dataset). As overall statistics, we found that one in three compounds in the {CSD} are polymorphic whilst at least one in two compounds from the Roche and Lilly set display polymorphism with a higher estimate of up to three in four when compounds are screened intensively. Whilst the statistics provide some guidance of expectations, each compound constitutes a new challenge and prediction and realization of targeted polymorphism still remains a holy grail of materials sciences.},

The device reproducibility is one of the principal weak points of organic electronics for further commercialization. To achieve a high device-to-device reproducibility it is essential to control the morphology and polymorphism of the active layer for {OFET} application. In this work, the preparation of thin films is reported based on blends of the organic semiconductor dibenzo-tetrathiafulvalene ({DB}-{TTF}) and polystyrene by a solution shearing technique compatible with upscaling.

In both the structures, the pyrimidine moieties of trimethoprim are protonated at one of the ring nitrogens. In both the forms, the carboxylate group interacts with the protonated pyrimidine ring to form the cyclic hydrogen-bonded bimolecular motif. These motifs are further self-organized into two different hydrogen-bonded networks. In compound 1, two of the centrosymmetrically-related motifs are hydrogen-bonded to give a complementary {DDAA} (D refers to the hydrogen bond donor and A refers to the hydrogen bond acceptor) array of quadruple hydrogen bonding pattern. In compound 2, two of the inversion-related motifs are paired through a pair of N–H⋯N hydrogen bonds involving the 2-amino group and the N3 atom. In addition to the pairing, one water molecule bridges the 4-amino group of one motif and the carboxylate oxygen of another motif on both sides of the pairing, leading to a complementary linear array of hydrogen bonds.},

In particular, anharmonicity is the driving force of vibrational relaxation processes, mechanisms that are integral to the proper function of numerous chemical processes. However, elucidating its origins has proven difficult due to experimental and theoretical challenges, specifically related to separating the anharmonic contributions from other unrelated effects. While no one technique is particularly suited for providing a complete picture of anharmonicity, by combining multiple complementary methods such a characterization can be made. In this study the role of individual atomic interactions on the anharmonic properties of crystalline purine, the building block of many {DNA} and {RNA} nucleobases, is studied by experimental terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory ({DFT}) and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations ({AIMD}},

Disordered crystalline systems, also known as plastic crystals, offer a unique perspective into these factors because the systems retain a degree of crystallinity, reducing the degrees of freedom that must be explored when interpreting the results. However, while disordered crystals do diffract X-rays, it is difficult to fully resolve meaningful crystalline structures, with the best scenario resulting in lattice parameters. In this study, we use a combination of experimental terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, and theoretical solid-state ab initio density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations to fully elucidate the structures and associated dynamics of organic molecular solids. The results highlight that this combination provides a complete description of the energetic and mechanistic pathways involved in the formation of disordered crystals, and highlights the importance of low-frequency dynamics in their properties. Finally, with structures fully determined and validated by the experimental results, recent progress into anharmonic calculations, namely the quasi-harmonic approximation method, enables full temperature and pressure-dependent properties to be understood within the framework of the potential energy hyper-surface structure.},

The low-frequency ({\textless}90 cm−1) terahertz spectra of both irbesartan Form A and Form B were measured and interpreted using solid-state density functional theory. The spectra reveal distinct identifying features for each polymorph and are indicative of the variations in the packing arrangements of the solids. The computational analyses of the solid-state forms also provide new insights into the origins and temperature dependence of the conformational disorder found in Form B.

N-Methyl-4-carboxypyridinium chloride is a solid that undergoes an apparent continuous temperature-dependent phase transition from an orthorhombic to a monoclinic polymorph. However, a hybrid characterization approach using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, and solid-state density functional theory reveals the transformation to be actually a slowly changing ratio of the two discrete polymorphic forms. The potential energy surface of this process can be directly accessed using terahertz radiation, and the data show that a very low barrier (43.3 J mol−1) exists along the polymorph transformation coordinate.},

The thermodynamics of solvent inclusion in the Form {II}·{MeOH} crystal system were determined from {MD} simulations, as was the favored conformation of molecular probucol in methanol and ethanol solutions. The ﬁndings from both solid-state {DFT} and {MD} calculations suggest that the preferred molecular orientations of the probucol molecule in solution and the probable inclusion of methanol in the crystal lattice during the crystallization process lead to the solvent selectivity of the probucol polymorph formation. The additional stabilization energy provided by the crystallization solvent facilitates the nucleation and growth of the Form {II} polymorph under conditions that favor this metastable crystal form over the thermodynamically stable Form I, despite the higher energy molecular and crystalline conﬁgurations of probucol Form {II}. We demonstrate the inﬂuence of solvent on the formation of pharmaceutical polymorphs and provide a molecular-level view of complex interactions leading to polymorphism using a combination of computational methods and {THz} spectral data.},

Five computational methods for performing this integration have evolved and have been applied so far. In this article these methods are analyzed for the first time on a general basis, and particular emphasis is put on resolution, accuracy and computing effort.

	abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed {DFT}-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C6RϪ6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals ({BLYP} and {PBE}), together with the resolution-of-the-identity ({RI}) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efﬁcient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended {AO} basis sets of polarized {TZV} or {QZV} quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefﬁcients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The “double counting” of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insigniﬁcant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, {CH}4, {NH}3, H2O, {CH}3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene ⅐ H2O and four H-bonded and stacked {DNA} base pairs ({AT} and {GC}). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the {DFT}-D-{BLYP} model seems to be even superior to standard {MP}2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the {DFT}-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-ﬁeld) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of the interaction energies.},

	abstract = {A new density functional ({DF}) of the generalized gradient approximation ({GGA}) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke’s power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 · R−6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals ({BLYP}, {PBE}, {TPSS}, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other {GGAs} and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group {II} element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difﬁcult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose {GGAs}, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol−1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average {CCSD}(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R−6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difﬁcult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only {DF} available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efﬁcient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.},

The process of calculating vibrational frequencies involves two steps: the determination of the equilibrium geometry, and the calculation of the frequencies themselves. The parameters controlling the truncation of the Coulomb and exchange series in Hartree–Fock, the quality of the grid used for the numerical integration of the Exchange-correlation potential in Density Functional Theory, the {SCF} convergence criteria, the parameters controlling the convergence of the optimization process as well as those controlling the accuracy of the numerical calculation of the Hessian matrix can inﬂuence the obtained vibrational frequencies to some extent.

The results obtained with four different Hamiltonians, namely Hartree–Fock, {DFT} in its local ({LDA}) and nonlocal gradient corrected ({PBE}) approximation, and hybrid B3LYP, are discussed, showing that B3LYP performs far better than {LDA} and {PBE}, which in turn provide better results than {HF}, as the mean absolute difference from experimental frequencies is 6, 18, 21, and 44 {cmϪ}1, respectively, when a split valence basis set containing two sets of polarization functions is used. For the {LDA} results, comparison is possible with previous calculations based on the Density Functional Perturbation Theory and usage of a plane-wave basis set.

These results show good agreement with density-functional-theory phonon calculations. Comparison of experimental spectra and calculated vibrational modes enables confident assignment of most of the vibrational features between 50 and 3500 cm−1. Reorientation of the methylammonium cations, unlocked in their cavities at the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition, plays a key role in shaping the vibrational spectra of the different compounds. Calculations show that these dynamic effects split Raman peaks and create more structure than predicted from the independent harmonic modes. This explains the presence of extra peaks in the experimental spectra that have been a source of confusion in earlier studies. We discuss singular features, in particular the torsional vibration of the C–N axis, which is the only molecular mode that is strongly influenced by the size of the lattice. From analysis of the spectral linewidths, we find that {MAPbI}3 shows exceptionally short phonon lifetimes, which can be linked to low lattice thermal conductivity. We show that optical rather than acoustic phonon scattering is likely to prevail at room temperature in these materials.},

	abstract = {We study the temperature-dependent phonon modes of the organometallic lead iodide perovskite {CH}3NH3PbI3 thin ﬁlm across the terahertz (0.5−3 {THz}) and temperature (20− 300 K) ranges. These modes are related to the vibration of the Pb−I bonds. We found that two phonon modes in the tetragonal phase at room temperature split into four modes in the lowtemperature orthorhombic phase. By use of the Lorentz model ﬁtting, we analyze the critical behavior of this phase transition. The carrier mobility values calculated from the low-temperature phonon mode frequencies, via two theoretical approaches, are found to agree reasonably with the experimental value (∼2000 cm2 V−1 s−1) from a previous time-resolved {THz} spectroscopy work. Thus, we have established a possible link between terahertz phonon modes and the transport properties of perovskite-based solar cells.},

	abstract = {The effects of applying an empirical dispersion correction to solid-state density functional theory methods were evaluated in the simulation of the crystal structure and low-frequency (10 to 90 cm−1) terahertz spectrum of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, naproxen. The naproxen molecular crystal is bound largely by weak London force interactions, as well as by more prominent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, and thus serves as a good model for the assessment of the pair-wise dispersion correction term in systems influenced by intermolecular interactions of various strengths. Modifications to the dispersion parameters were tested in both fully optimized unit cell dimensions and those determined by X-ray crystallography, with subsequent simulations of the {THz} spectrum being performed. Use of the unmodified {PBE} density functional leads to an unrealistic expansion of the unit cell volume and the poor representation of the {THz} spectrum. Inclusion of a modified dispersion correction enabled a high-quality simulation of the {THz} spectrum and crystal structure of naproxen to be achieved without the need for artificially constraining the unit cell dimensions.},

It is, therefore, important to include corrections for these forces in periodic density functional theory ({DFT}) calculations of lattice vibrational frequencies. In this study, {DFT} was augmented with a correction term for London-type dispersion forces in the simulations of the structures and terahertz ({THz}) vibrational spectra of the dispersion-bound solids naphthalene and durene. The parameters of the correction term were modiﬁed to best reproduce the experimental crystal structures and {THz} spectra. It was found that the accurate reproduction of the lattice dimensions by adjusting the magnitude of the applied dispersion forces resulted in the highest-quality ﬁt of the calculated vibrational modes with the observed {THz} absorptions. The method presented for the modiﬁcation of the dispersion corrections provides a practical approach to accurately simulating the {THz} spectra of molecular crystals, accounting for inherent systematic errors imposed by computational and experimental factors.},

Terahertz spectral databases of modern and ancient artists’ pigments exist but lack explanations for the origins of the unique spectral features. Solid-state density functional theory simulations can provide insight into the molecular and intermolecular forces that dominate the observed absorption features as well as reveal deviations from simple harmonic vibrational behavior that can complicate these spectra. The characteristic terahertz spectra of solid azurite, malachite, and verdigris are presented here, along with simulations of their crystalline structures and sub-3.0 {THz} lattice vibrations. The powerful combination of theory and experiment enables unambiguous spectral assignment of these complex materials and highlights the challenges that anharmonic peak broadening in organic-containing materials may present in the construction of reference pigment databases.},

As well as structures that are made public to support scientific articles, it includes many structures published directly as CSD Communications. All structures are processed both computationally and by expert structural chemistry editors prior to entering the database. A key component of this processing is the reliable association of the chemical identity of the structure studied with the experimental data. This important step helps ensure that data is widely discoverable and readily reusable. Content is further enriched through selective inclusion of additional experimental data. Entries are available to anyone through free CSD community web services. Linking services developed and maintained by the CCDC, combined with the use of standard identifiers, facilitate discovery from other resources.

The first, located in the 1920s and 1930s, is about a computational approach that aimed at pragmatics rather than truth and that remained remarkably robust when quantum theory arrived. The second episode covers the birth of the LJ substance in 1964. Due to increasing interest in computer methods, simulated model substances became objects on their own, the prime targets of investigation. The history of the LJ potential and substance exemplifies the dynamic relationship between prediction, theory, mathematization, and computer instrumentation.},

            The development of reliable and extensible molecular mechanics ({MM}) force fields—fast, empirical models characterizing the potential energy surface of molecular systems—is indispensable for biomolecular simulation and computer-aided drug design. Here, we introduce a generalized and extensible machine-learned {MM} force field, espaloma-0.3, and an end-to-end differentiable framework using graph neural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based methods. Trained in a single {GPU}-day to fit a large and diverse quantum chemical dataset of over 1.1 M energy and force calculations, espaloma-0.3 reproduces quantum chemical energetic properties of chemical domains highly relevant to drug discovery, including small molecules, peptides, and nucleic acids. Moreover, this force field maintains the quantum chemical energy-minimized geometries of small molecules and preserves the condensed phase properties of peptides and folded proteins, self-consistently parametrizing proteins and ligands to produce stable simulations leading to highly accurate predictions of binding free energies. This methodology demonstrates significant promise as a path forward for systematically building more accurate force fields that are easily extensible to new chemical domains of interest.},

The development of new light-absorbing polymers has driven tremendous advances in the power conversion efficiency of these devices. In particular, the use of alternating electron rich (donor) and electron poor (acceptor) segments along the polymer backbone can produce low optical bandgap materials that capture more of the solar spectrum. As a result, power conversion efficiencies over 10% are increasingly common for this technology. This review summarizes the recent advances in donor-acceptor polymer design and synthesis, highlighting the structural features that are key to providing high efficiency, scalable and stable devices.}

Abstract = {Compton profiles (CPs) of TM2O3 (TM = Ti, V and Cr) have been measured using 100 mCi 241Am Compton spectrometer. The experimental momentum densities have been used to check the applicability of exchange-correlation energies using pure and hybrid density functional theory (DFT). Present ab-initio computations have been accomplished using the texture of Gaussian orbitals within linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) scheme. Based on experimental and theoretical CPs, hybrid DFT schemes namely B3LYP and PBESOL0 have shown better performance than pure DFT (within local density and generalized gradient approximation), whereas the best agreement (through χ2 fitting of goodness) is obtained for B3LYP prescriptions. Besides Compton spectroscopy, the spin-up (↑) energy bands and density of states (DOS) have confirmed the metallic nature of all three compounds, whereas the spin-down (↓) energy bands and DOS for Ti2O3 and V2O3 have shown a peculiar semiconducting behaviour leading to their },

abstract = {Abstract We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Grid-connected utility-scale solar PV has emerged as a potential pathway to ensure deep decarbonization of electricity in regions with fossil fuel-dominated energy mixes. Research on utility-scale solar PV projects mainly focuses on assessing technical or economic feasibility. Environmental performance assessments of large-scale solar applications are scarce. There is limited information on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy footprints of utility-scale solar energy systems. Earlier studies conducted on small-scale solar systems have limited application in the grid system. We developed a comprehensive bottom-up life cycle assessment model to evaluate the life cycle GHG emissions and energy profiles of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) system with lithium-ion battery storage to provide a consistent electricity supply to the grid with peak load options. We conducted a case study for a fossil fuel-based energy jurisdiction, Alberta (a western province in Canada). The results of the energy assessment show that raw material extraction, production, and assembly of solar panels are the key drivers, accounting for 53% of the total consumption. Energy consumed during battery manufacturing is responsible for 28%. The system shows a net energy production with a mean net energy ratio as high as 6.6 for two-axis sun tracking orientation. The life cycle GHG emissions range from 98.3 to 149.3 g CO2 eq /kWh with a mean value of 123.8 g CO2 eq /kWh. The largest emissions contribution is due to the manufacturing of batteries, 54% of the total emissions. The solar PV system offers a mean energy payback time of 3.8 years (with a range of 3.3 to 4.2 years). The results are highly sensitive to the expected lifetime of the system, the panel’s peak wattage, and process energy consumption at various life cycle stages.}

In this work, we expand upon the original concept and present a refined version of this software, termed mBuild , which is a general tool for constructing arbitrarily complex input configurations for molecular simulation in a programmatic fashion. Basic molecular components are connected using an equivalence operator which reduces and often removes the need for users to explicitly rotate and translate components as they assemble systems. Additionally, the programmatic nature of this approach and integration with the scientific Python ecosystem seamlessly exposes high-level variables that users can tune to alter the chemical composition of their systems, such as mixtures of polymers of different chain lengths and surface patterning. Leveraging these features, we demonstrate how mBuild serves as a stepping stone towards screening and performing optimizations in chemical parameter space of complex materials by performing automated screening studies of monolayer systems as a function of graft type, degree of polymerization, and surface density.}, booktitle={Foundations of Molecular Modeling and Simulation: Select Papers from FOMMS 2015}, publisher={Springer Singapore}, author={Klein, Christoph and Sallai, János and Jones, Trevor J. and Iacovella, Christopher R. and McCabe, Clare and Cummings, Peter T. and Snurr, Randall Q and Adjiman, Claire S. and Kofke, David A.}, year={2016}, pages={79–92}, collection={Molecular Modeling and Simulation} }

Ambiguity in molecular models often stems from inadequate usage documentation of molecular force fields and the fact that force fields are not typically disseminated in a format that is directly usable by software. Specifically, the lack of a generally applicable scheme for the annotation of the rules of a particular force field and a general purpose tool for performing automated parameterization (i.e., atom-typing) based on these rules, may lead to errors in model parameterization that are not easily identified. Here, we present Foyer, an open-source Python tool that enables users to define and apply force field atom-typing rules in a format that is both human- and machine-readable and provides a framework for force field dissemination, thus eliminating ambiguity in atom-typing and improving reproducibility. Foyer defines force fields in an XML format, where SMARTS strings are used to define the chemical context of a particular atom type and “overrides” are used to set rule precedence, rather than a rigid hierarchical scheme. Herein we describe the underlying methodology and force field annotation scheme of the Foyer software, demonstrate its application in several use-cases, and discuss specific aspects of the Foyer approach that are designed to improve reproducibility.}, journal={Computational Materials Science}, author={Klein, Christoph and Summers, Andrew Z. and Thompson, Matthew W. and Gilmer, Justin B. and McCabe, Clare and Cummings, Peter T. and Sallai, Janos and Iacovella, Christopher R.}, year={2019}, month={Sep}, pages={215–227} }

	abstract = {Electronic and optical properties of conjugated polymers are strongly aﬀected by their solid-state microstructure. In nematic polymers, mesoscopic order and structure can be theoretically understood using Maier−Saupe ({MS}) models, motivating us to apply them to conjugated macromolecular systems and consider the problem of their material-speciﬁc parametrization. {MS} models represent polymers by worm-like chains ({WLC}) and can describe collective polymer alignment through anisotropic {MS} interactions. Their strength is controlled by a phenomenological temperaturedependent parameter, υ(T). We undertake the challenging task of estimating material-speciﬁc υ(T), combining experiments and Self-Consistent Field theory ({SCFT}). Considering three diﬀerent materials and a spectrum of molecular weights, we cover the cases of rod-like, semiﬂexible, and ﬂexible conjugated polymers. The temperature of the isotropic−nematic transition, {TIN}, is identiﬁed via polarized optical microscopy and spectroscopy. The polymers are mapped on {WLC} with temperature-dependent persistence length. Fixed persistence lengths are also considered, reproducing situations addressed in earlier studies. We estimate υ(T) by matching {TIN} in experiments and {SCFT} treatment of the {MS} model. An important conclusion is that accounting explicitly for changes of persistence length with temperature has signiﬁcant qualitative eﬀects on υ(T). We moreover correlate our ﬁndings with earlier discussions on the thermodynamic nature of phenomenological {MS} interactions.},

Here, perylene not only works as a hole conductor but also contributes to photovoltage as a photoconductor. The crystalline plane orientation of perovskite prepared on {TiO}2 was controlled by thermal annealing such that the lead halide (110) plane that participates in carrier conduction is highly oriented to enhance the photovoltaic performance. The crystal orientation improves the heterojunction structure with perylene. For the best cell with high crystalline orientation, a total voltage loss is significantly minimized to 0.32 V with respect to the absorption band gap of 1.55 {eV}. The planar crystal cells generate high open-circuit voltages of 1.15–1.22 V, which is close to a theoretical maximal voltage (1.25–1.3 V) described by the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit. The cell yielded energy conversion efficiency up to 4.96\%.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained significant attention as adsorbent and membrane materials for gas separations. Due to the large number and diversity of existing MOFs, identifying the best MOF materials for a gas separation of interest is very challenging. High-throughput computational screening studies have played an important role in accurately assessing adsorption and membrane-based gas separation performances of MOFs in a time-efficient manner. Computational methods, mainly molecular simulations, are invaluable in narrowing down the number of promising MOFs from thousands to tens and directing the future experimental efforts, resources, and time to the best materials. In this review, we addressed the recent advances in high-throughput computational screening methods used for MOFs and described how to use the results of computer simulations to predict various adsorbent and membrane performance metrics of MOFs. Current large-scale computational studies on using MOFs for different gas separations were then reviewed. Finally, both the opportunities and challenges in the field were discussed to shed light on future MOF studies.}
